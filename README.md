# VIRTUAL_POSTCARDS_PORTUGAL
A virtual card designed (html, css, javascript) for those who want to enjoy and discover the unique nature of the country.
The idea and realization came to the mind one rainy day when the sun was so far away. The idea to show the sunny country, we have lived in for 8 years, not only as a place for charter flights and stopping at some popular resort points... but.. to show what still needs to be explored (if you want to go there) to get the spirit of the people and the land.
